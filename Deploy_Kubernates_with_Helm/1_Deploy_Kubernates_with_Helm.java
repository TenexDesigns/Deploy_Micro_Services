Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the process of managing complex Kubernetes applications. It is used in conjunction with Docker and Kubernetes to deploy and manage applications. The following steps outline how to use Helm, Docker images, and Kubernetes together:

1. **Create Docker Images**: The first step is to create Docker images for your application. Docker images are lightweight, standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files [Source 0](https://ignaciocicero.medium.com/docker-kubernetes-helm-a-comprehensive-step-by-step-using-java-df83f6780d80).

```bash
docker build -t my_tag .
```

2. **Push Docker Images to a Registry**: After creating the Docker images, push them to a Docker registry. This can be Docker Hub, Google Container Registry (GCR), or any other Docker image registry.

```bash
docker push my_tag
```

3. **Create Helm Charts**: Helm uses a packaging format called charts. A chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. A single chart might be used to deploy something simple, like a memcached pod, or something complex, like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, caches, etc [Source 1](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/kubernetes-helm).

4. **Deploy Application Using Helm**: After creating the Helm charts, you can deploy your application onto a Kubernetes cluster. Helm uses the charts to deploy and manage the application on the Kubernetes cluster [Source 1](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/kubernetes-helm).

```bash
helm install --name hello-world ./hello-world
```

5. **Update Application Using Helm**: If you need to update your application, Helm makes it easy. You can change your Helm chart and then update the application using the Helm upgrade command [Source 19](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/helm-charts-tutorial-the-kubernetes-package-manager-explained/).

```bash
helm upgrade my-apache ./my-apache
```

6. **Rollback Using Helm**: If an update goes wrong, Helm allows you to rollback to a previous release [Source 19](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/helm-charts-tutorial-the-kubernetes-package-manager-explained/).

```bash
helm rollback my-apache 1
```

7. **Delete a Release Using Helm**: If you no longer need a release, you can delete it using Helm [Source 19](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/helm-charts-tutorial-the-kubernetes-package-manager-explained/).

```bash
helm delete my-apache
```

Helm simplifies the complexity of Kubernetes by packaging all the complexity of an application into one simple application that can be configured. It helps manage microservices, prevent bad configurations, and share common applications like databases, CMSs, etc. This makes it easier to manage and deploy applications on Kubernetes [Source 22](https://spot.io/resources/kubernetes-architecture/kubernetes-helm-k8s-application-deployment-made-simple/). 

To use Helm, you first need to install Helm on your machine and have access to a Kubernetes cluster. You also need to create Docker images for your application and push them to a Docker registry [Source 24](https://circleci.com/blog/what-is-helm/).
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                               ....
