The error message you're encountering suggests that `kubectl` (the Kubernetes command-line tool) is unable to find the necessary Kubernetes configuration files for your Minikube cluster. This typically happens when the required certificates and configuration files are missing or corrupted. To resolve this issue, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check Minikube Status**:

   Make sure that your Minikube cluster is running and in a healthy state. You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   minikube status
   ```

   If Minikube is not running or is in an error state, you should start it or fix any issues first.

2. **Reconfigure `kubectl`**:

   You need to configure `kubectl` to use the context of your Minikube cluster. You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   kubectl config use-context minikube
   ```

   This command sets the active context to "minikube," which should match your Minikube cluster.

3. **Verify Kubernetes Configuration**:

   Make sure your Minikube configuration files exist in the expected locations. You can check the `kubectl` configuration by running:

   ```bash
   kubectl config view
   ```

   This command displays the current `kubectl` configuration. Verify that the paths to the certificate and key files, as well as the certificate authority file, are correct.

4. **Recreate Minikube Configuration** (if needed):

   If you find that the certificate and key files are indeed missing or incorrect, you may need to recreate your Minikube cluster configuration. Here's how to do it:

   a. Stop Minikube if it's running:

      ```bash
      minikube stop
      ```

   b. Delete the Minikube cluster:

      ```bash
      minikube delete
      ```

   c. Start a new Minikube cluster:

      ```bash
      minikube start
      ```

   Minikube will recreate the cluster and generate the necessary configuration files.

5. **Check File Permissions**:

   Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the configuration files. If you're on Windows, ensure that you're running the terminal as an administrator or with the necessary permissions.

6. **Reinstall Minikube and kubectl** (if needed):

   If the problem persists and you suspect that Minikube or `kubectl` might be corrupted, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling both of them.

After following these steps, you should be able to use Minikube and `kubectl` with your local Kubernetes cluster without encountering the file-not-found errors.
