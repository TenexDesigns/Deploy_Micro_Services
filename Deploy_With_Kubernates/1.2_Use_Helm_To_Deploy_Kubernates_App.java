Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm makes it easy to deploy and manage complex Kubernetes applications. Helm charts are packages that contain all of the resources that are needed to deploy and run a Kubernetes application, such as Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps.

To use Helm, you will first need to install it on your machine. You can do this by following the instructions on the Helm website.

Once Helm is installed, you can create a Helm chart for your application. To do this, you will need to create a YAML file that describes the resources that are needed to deploy your application. You can use the Helm documentation to learn more about how to create Helm charts.

Once you have created a Helm chart, you can deploy it to Kubernetes using the helm install command. This command will create all of the resources that are defined in your Helm chart in your Kubernetes cluster.

Helm charts can be used to deploy a wide variety of Kubernetes applications, including microservices, databases, and web applications. Helm charts can also be used to manage the configuration of your Kubernetes applications.

Helm solves the complexity issue with Kubernetes by making it easy to deploy and manage complex Kubernetes applications. Helm charts provide a simple way to package and deploy Kubernetes applications, and they also make it easy to manage the configuration of Kubernetes applications.

To use Helm, you will need to:

Install Helm on your machine.
Create a Helm chart for your application.
Deploy the Helm chart to Kubernetes using the helm install command.
Here is a simple example of how to use Helm:

# Create a Helm chart for a simple web application
helm create my-app

# Deploy the Helm chart to Kubernetes
helm install my-app my-app
This will create a simple web application in your Kubernetes cluster. You can then access the web application at http://localhost:8080.

You can learn more about Helm and how to use it on the Helm website.

Relation between Helm and Docker images

Helm charts can be used to deploy Docker images to Kubernetes. To do this, you will need to specify the Docker image that you want to deploy in your Helm chart.

For example, the following Helm chart deploys the nginx:latest Docker image to Kubernetes:

YAML
apiVersion: v2
name: my-app
description: A simple web application
version: 1.0.0
appVersion: 1.0.0
dependencies: []
icon: https://example.com/icon.png
Use code with caution. Learn more
YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
Use code with caution. Learn more
To deploy this Helm chart to Kubernetes, you would use the following command:

helm install my-app my-app
This would create a Deployment in your Kubernetes cluster that deploys the nginx:latest Docker image.

Conclusion

Helm is a powerful tool for deploying and managing Kubernetes applications. Helm charts make it easy to package and deploy complex Kubernetes applications, and they also make it easy to manage the configuration of Kubernetes applications.

I recommend that you use Helm if you are planning on deploying Kubernetes applications. Helm can help you to save time and complexity when deploying and managing your Kubernetes applications.
